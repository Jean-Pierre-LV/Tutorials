# Tutorials
The principal idea to create this repository of Neural Networks, is shown the a easy way to create this Networks for your own problems. The programming language will be Python.
The Neural Networks that will be shown are:
1. Multilayer Perceptron
2. Support Vector Machine
3. Convolutional Neural Network
4. Long short Term Memory

# Tutorials
The principal idea to create this repository of Neural Networks, is shown the a easy way to create this Networks for your own problems.
The Neural Networks that will be shown are:
1. Multilayer Perceptron
2. Support Vector Machine
3. Convolutional Neural Network
4. Long short Term Memory

The programming language will be Python. I recommed to install Anaconda software for any SO:

Usually we will need these packages requirements:

- Python 3.7
- NumPy 
- Pandas 
- Scikit-learn
- SciPy
- Statsmodels
- MatplotLib 
- Tensorflow
- Keras

They can be installed separately using these commands:
(conda install nameofpackage) or (pip install nameofpackage)
